\begin{abstract}
\parttitle{Background}
The integration of heterogeneous, multi-scale, and multi-modal knowledge and data has become a common prerequisite for joint analysis to unravel the mechanisms and aetiologies of complex diseases.
Because of its unique ability to capture this variety, Biological Expression Language (BEL) is well suited to be further used as a platform for semantic integration and harmonization in networks and systems biology.
\parttitle{Results}
We have developed numerous independent packages capable of downloading, structuring, and serializing various biological data sources to BEL. Each Bio2BEL package is implemented in the Python programming language and distributed through GitHub (\url{https://github.com/bio2bel}) and PyPI\@.
\parttitle{Conclusions}
The philosophy of Bio2BEL encourages reproducibility, accessibility, and democratization of biological databases.
We present several applications of Bio2BEL packages including their ability to support the curation of pathway mappings, integration of pathway databases, and machine learning applications.
